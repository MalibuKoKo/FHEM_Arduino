# FHEM Arduino
A library for arduino to communicate with a FHEM Server

## What is supported?
This is a simple library to communicate with a FHEM Server. It allows to send and receive data. Basic Auth (Username and Password) is supported and CSRF-Token support is also included.

## What is not supported?
Any other security (SSL/custom certificates) are not supported. I do not have this set up and as such I do not know if it works or not.
